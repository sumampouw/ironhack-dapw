# Spica Sumampouw

Hi Spica! You finished the Prework, which is the first step in Ironhack. Great, great work here! It seems that you have put a lot of effort to solve the assignments in such a perfect way, congrats!

## 1. Snail and the well

In this exercise you had to work with `while` loops and `if` conditions essentially. It seems that you have understood how it works, great!
First of all, you don't need to write the variables in every cell that you are gonna use them, once time is enough for Python. 

In the main question, you had to compare with operators the distance rose by the snail and the height of the well. It would be something like this:

```python
while snail_position <= well_height:
    days += 1
    snail_position += daily_distance
    if snail_position <= well_height:
        snail_position -= nightly_distance
```
If you have any question, feel free to ask  me!

Anyway, the logic behind your code is good, if you have this problem with the `while` loop in count, good work using the `statistics` library!

## 2. Duel of sorcerers

Great work and great effort shown here, congrats! 

Overall, the solutions are perfect but you can optimize your code easily with a `for` loop and some `if/elif/else` conditions. 

If you have any free time and you want to try, it would be perfect. Again, you can ask me if you need it. 

Great work!

## 3. Bus

Brilliant job here! You had to work with a list of tuples and with `for` loops and it seems that you understood it perfectly. 

## 4. Robin Hood

Another great work! Just check the operators and the context above the questions to understand the different zones. 

## 5. Temperature

Here you had to work with operators and you did it perfectly again, I have nothing else to say, congrats!

## 6. Rock, paper, scissors

Wow Spica, I'm impressed with your work here! Congrats, you solved this assignment in the best possible way!

Brilliant that you used `try and except`, you defined functions properly and you created dictionaries and played with them. Great again!
